# Sponge Bucket server access

A minimal C# CLI server client.

## Features
- Node ID assignment (`node_01`, `node_02`, ...)
- credits: (this one has 50 credits)
- Commands: `touch`(adds a file), `del`(deletes a file), `ls`, `mem`(states how many credits you have left), `edit`, `exit`

## How to Run
1. Start the .cs file
2. connect to the ip address stated
## Debuging
if the server client is refusing to connect, that might be because the server is down/off

I wish to take this to the next step by using a aws instance as my server,`t4g.small` or the `m6id.large` to be exact 

## Coming Soon
- `store`, `query`, `clean`, `rename`, `echo`
